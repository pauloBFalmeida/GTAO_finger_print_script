# Presentation
Welcome to the door hack script, please read this entire file first before using
If you feel uncomfortable using the .exe and prefer the .ahk and .py, please go to my other repository
https://github.com/pauloBFalmeida/GTAO_finger_print_script

# Keys
shift + F1: enter the response to the finger print
(press this once the patterns have appeared, and the selector must be in most top left position)

shift + F2: enter the response to the keypad
(you can press this as long as the dots are appearing, doesn't need to be the final combination, as long as the dots are bliking you can press.
Important: the selector must be in the top position, once the blinking of the dots have stopped you have 2 seconds to put in the top position
This is a crucial step, because after you finish the first dot combination the selector will start in the last position from the previous game)

shift + F3: toggle repeated click of the left mouse button, to take cash/gold
(press to activate and press again to stop)

shift + ESC: kills the application (this script, not the game)

# Files Needed
You only need the 'doorHack.exe' and the 'answer' folder to be in the same directory, so keep them together
After you confirm that the script is working feel free to delete the fixingProblems folder

# Setup 
Test the script before using in the heist.
Inside 'FixingProblems' folder are more information about it
(you also should try in game, on the training device to make sure it works)

# Bugs and Problems
Please look at the 'FixingProblems' folder

# Run
Just run the .exe, and when you are in game press the <Keys> to run the action

# Stop
<shift + ESC> should kill the script (not the game).
But if doesn't just go to your taskbar, then right-click on the green "H" icon and select "Exit".
In the last case scenario re-start your computer

# Some possible questions and answers

-Can I get banned for using this script:

Yes it's possible, but really unlikely because the script takes a screen, analizes, and then ahk press the sequence of buttons
so to gta ban you it has to be something like:
A) GTA bans everybody that are using ahk, it is unlikely because its not a real hack, its just some coordenated inputs
and the devs prefer to take out real hackers and glitches
B) GTA implements some way to detect if the inputs in this minigame of this one mission are too robotic to be a real human doing it
and decides to ban you for saving like 5 seconds, after spending some hours doing the preps

-If you use this you will never learn how to actually do it:

Yeah it's true, but why do you NEED to learn how to do it, do you wanna get a graduation on GTA5?
Or just to brag "Haa on your face 14 year old cousin, i can do it 2 seconds faster you looooser"

-Don't you think that using this is wrong?

I think that making people play for hours to get not that much in game currency is wrong,
saving some seconds in the mission isn't immoral

-I can already solve really fast, why should i use this?

You don't really need to use this script if you don't want, but it does solve faster than a normal human,
and this minigame is very repetitive. In the end you aren't going to get smarter by doing this minigame on your own anyway

-It isn't working, how do I fix it?

As writen before please look at the 'FixingProblems' folder
