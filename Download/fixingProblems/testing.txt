Stop the script (shift + esc, or on the toolbar, or if it isn't open then just proceed)

Open the 'settings.ini' inside the 'answer' folder

Then change this lines:
showContours = False	to 	showContours = True
showDots = False	to 	showDots = True

Save the settings.ini file

After that run the script 'doorHackTest.exe'
(this one isn't going to press any keys, just take the screenshot and analize)

Open the 'screenshots' folder and put one of the images in fullscreen
Then execute keys in the script (shift+F1 or shift+F2)
Now some images are going to apear
Check to see if they are similar with the other ones inside 'outputs' folder
(in Contours, all the boxes should have that tick gray outline)

If they are, you are fine and the script should run just fine

If any of them aren't then open the 'settings.ini'
And for each one that doesn't match follow the instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------
Contours:

-Not all/None boxes are appearing:
Try changing these float values inside 0.0 to 1.0:

parts_str_h = 0.2
parts_end_h = 0.8
parts_str_w = 0.2
parts_end_w = 0.45

the _h stands for height, and the _w for width
while _str stands for start, and end to the end
this delimits the area of the screen that is cropped

-The gray contours are not matching, or missing:
try changing this integer between 0 to 255

threshold = 33

maybe the image is in a weird size or deformed so try changing
it resizes the whole screenshot size

resize_size = 1000,600

-The gray contours are fine but it still doesn't work:
try changing this integer between -25 to 25 
(the number could possible be biger than 25 or smaller then -25, but it's unlikely)

margin = 5

maybe the image is in a weird size or deformed so try changing
it resizes the whole screenshot size

resize_size = 1000,600

--------------------------------------------------------------
dots:

-Not all/None dots are appearing:
Try changing these float values inside 0.0 to 1.0:

str_h = 0.25
end_h = 0.78
str_w = 0.2
end_w = 0.6

the _h stands for height, and the _w for width
while _str stands for start, and end to the end
this delimits the area of the screen that is cropped

or try changing this integer between 0 to 255

threshold = 120

maybe the image is in a weird size or deformed so try changing
it resizes the whole screenshot size

resize_size = 1000,600

-The dots are fine but it still doesn't work:
try changing this integer between 0 and 120 
(the number could possible be biger, but it's unlikely)

circle_size = 60

it uses this circle size to find the line and column of each dot

try changing this integer between 0 and 100
(the number could possible be biger, but it's unlikely)

str_x = 50
str_y = 40

it uses this as the top left circle (it might not be lit up, but it isn't a problem)

maybe the image is in a weird size or deformed so try changing
it resizes the whole screenshot size

resize_size = 1000,600

maybe the time between each screenshot isn't wright
try changing this float between 0.01 to 1.0:
(closest to 0 more screenshots per second, if its 1.0 it will take 1 shot per second)

sleep_time = 0.2

--------------------------------------------------------------
If none of this helps maybe this script isn't going to work for you
:(
