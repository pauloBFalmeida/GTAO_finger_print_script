# Presentation
Welcome to the door hack script, please read this entire file first before using
If you feel uncomfortable using the .exe and prefer the .ahk and .py, please go to my other repository
https://github.com/pauloBFalmeida/GTAO_finger_print_script

# Keys
shift + F1: enter the response to the finger print
(press this once the patterns have appeared, and the selector must be in most top left position)

shift + F2: enter the response to the keypad
(you can press this as long as the dots are appearing, doesn't need to be the final combination, as long as the dots are bliking you can press.
Important: the selector must be in the top position, once the blinking of the dots have stopped you have 2 seconds to put in the top position
This is a crucial step, because after you finish the first dot combination the selector will start in the last position from the previous game)

shift + F3: toggle repeated click of the left mouse button, to take cash/gold
(press to activate and press again to stop)

shift + ESC: kills the application (this script, not the game)

# Files Needed
You need the 'doorHack.exe' and the 'answer' folder to be in the same directory, so keep them together

# Setup 
Before using this script in the heist, try it out to make sure it works

# Bugs and Problems
Please look at the 'FixingProblems.txt'

# Run
Just run the .exe, and when you are in game press the <Keys> to run the action

# Stop
<shift + ESC> should kill the script (not the game).
But if doesn't just go to your taskbar, then right-click on the green "H" icon and select "Exit".
In the last case scenario re-start your computer
