# Keys
shift + F1: return response to the finger print (press this once the patterns have appeared, and your selector must be in most top left position)
shift + F2: toggle repeated click of the left mouse button (press to activate and press again to stop)
shift + ESC: kills the application (this script, not the game)

# Files Needed
You should only need the .exe if u want to use it

The .ahk contains the code (if you want to look or modify)
The .py its for testing the script (if you want to run, you must have python3 and pygame)
The .jpg is for the testing (the background image for the .py)

# Run
Just run the .exe, and when you are in game press the <Keys> to run the action

# Stop
<shift + ESC> should kill the script (not the game).
But if doesn't just go to your taskbar, then right-click on the green "H" icon and select "Exit".
In the last case scenario re-start your computer

# In case of bugs
It's an ahk (autohotkeys) script, so if u need any help with a bug its probably easyer to search in some ahk forum or something like that
